SystemsAnalysisAndDesignExample
===============================

This is an example of one of my projects where I used a formal requirements gathering approach. Although I put a ton of time into designing and implementing it, it was only a partial success. Because of this, it became a great tool for illustrating that you need the right tool for the right job.   

The approach I used in this one was Systems  Analysis and Design (SSAD). This approach identifies the methods and processes needed to complete a particular user task. It is more applicable to Database development and functional programming. The issue was that was using an Object Oriented programming paradigm for the software implementation = inadequate upfront design. I needed to interpolate the objects eventually during design anyways.
