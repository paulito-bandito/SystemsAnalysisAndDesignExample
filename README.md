SystemsAnalysisAndDesignExample
===============================

This is an example of one of my projects where I used a formal requirements gathering approach. Although I put a ton of time into designing and implementing it, it was only a partial success. In this partial success though, it became a great tool for illustrating that you need the right tool for the right job.   

The approach I used in this one was Systems  Analysis and Design (SSAD). This approach identifies the methods and processes needed to complete a particular user task. It is more applicable to Database development and functional programming.    

Although it wasn't the right approach (there was an impedance mismatch because I was using an Object Oriented programming paradigm), I thought it was a very informative and wanted to post it here on GitHub for others to learn from as well.
